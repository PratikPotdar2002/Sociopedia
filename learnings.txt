1)Do not make typs while writing endpoints test out the endpoints on postman if needed
2)Use try catch block to see is value is being assigned or not.
3)when we are using req.body then we are passing down the body through the request like as follow
		  const patchLike = async () => {
    		  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3001/posts/${postId}/like`, {
     		  method: "PATCH",
     		  headers: {
        	  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
        	  "Content-Type": "application/json",
      		  },
     		  body: JSON.stringify({ userId: loggedInUserId }), <_______like this
   		 });
   		 const updatedPost = await response.json();
  		 dispatch(setPost({ post: updatedPost }));
  		 };

4) if our endpoint is like this (router.patch("/:id/like",verifyToken,likePost)) for example  then *we have* to consume endpoint using same name as id while consuming it.   -----doubt

Colon (:) in router.patch("/:id/like", verifyToken, likePost):

In Express.js and many other web frameworks, the colon (:) is used to define route parameters in URL patterns. When a request matches a route pattern with a colon-prefixed segment, Express.js extracts that segment from the URL and makes it available as a property on the req.params object.
So, in the route pattern "/:id/like", :id is a route parameter representing a dynamic segment in the URL. For example, if a request is made to /123/like, Express.js would extract 123 as the value of req.params.id.

5)Underscore (_) in http://localhost:3001/users/${_id}/${friendId}:

In this URL template, the underscore (_) is typically used as a variable placeholder. It's often replaced with a specific value when the URL is constructed dynamically. For example, in a JavaScript template string like ${_id}, _id would be a variable holding the value that should replace the underscore in the URL.
So, http://localhost:3001/users/${_id}/${friendId} might be used as a template to construct a URL dynamically where _id and friendId are variables representing specific IDs or values.

6)Mongodb URL password can not contain special chars
